The data (bupadata.txt) is actual data of patients with liver disorders. There are two categories of patients.
These categories are represented in the 7th parameter of each line.

Each line of data contains:
1. mcv mean corpuscular volume
2. alkphos alkaline phosphotase
3. sgpt alamine aminotransferase
4. sgot aspartate aminotransferase
5. gammagt gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase
6. drinks number of half-pint equivalents of alcoholic beverages drunk per day
7. category

Your goal is to create a decision tree that best sorts the data into the categories indicated by the 7th parameter.
For each of the six characteristics, you will need to find a value that best splits the data into two categories.
Then you will need to compute the entropy decrease of each parameter, and make the decision tree using the parameter that decreases entropy the most.
Repeat this for all parameters until the decision tree is complete.
To make sure your decision tree works, use about 3/4ths of the 295 data points as training data and 1/4th as test data.
Don't overfit the data! You want to minimize test error, not train error.
Lastly, don't try to cheat (we know that the data is public). This problem is just to help you learn the basics.
