            Code Submission
        </h3>
            <p><i>7/1/17 -&emsp;</i>Last year, we used <a href="https://www.dropitto.me">dropitto.me</a> as a simple way of submitting your code for grading. Since the service shut down this summer, we
                are currently working on finding a replacement. We'll update this page before competitions start in October. As of now, we are planning on setting up a kaggle classroom. This will allow us to automatically handle creating competitions, posting data, and grading submissions. More information can be found on <a href="https://inclass.kaggle.com/">kaggle's website</a>.</p>

        </h3>
            <p><i>6/21/17 -&emsp;</i>The year is finally over! We've got two months of summer ahead of us, but your ML Club officers already have a few plans for September.
		First and foremost, we plan on expanding into a second room so that everyone can come. </p>
            <p>Secondly, we will split into two groups. This will allow the club to cover complex topics with advanced members while not alienating newcomers. 
		Higher-level lectures with less mathematical rigor will be given to Freshmen/Sophmores in APCS with little Python or AI experience.
		    These lectures will be similar to this past year's, covering standard ML algorithms and the basics of Deep Learning.
		    For those already familiar with machine learning, we're making new, rigorous lectures, covering topics from object detection to language translation and combating networks.
		</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we're formalizing our mentoring initiative.
	We've already helped a variety of projects off the books, but the ever-growing popularity of machine learning as a research tool allows us to make this a permanent part of the club.
	Look for forms in September.
	    </p>
	<p>
	Finally, our website will undergo heavy renovation as we upgrade all of the lectures. 
	We look forward to seeing everyone in the fall!</p>
